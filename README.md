# HTTP from TCP

This repository is a **study project** focused on implementing HTTP on top of raw TCP.  
It is not intended for production use â€” the goal is purely educational, to better understand how HTTP works under the hood.  

ðŸ“Œ This project is a work in progress and serves as a learning exercise.
